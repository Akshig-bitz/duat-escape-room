<h1>𓂀 THE DUAT AWAITS 𓂀</h1>

<p>
You are a team of archaeologists who have stepped beyond the mortal world.
The Feather of Ma’at has been stolen.
The Scales of Judgment stand unbalanced.

<h1>⚖ ACCESS THE HALL OF JUDGMENT ⚖</h1>

<p>
You stand before the sealed gates of the Hall of Weighing.
Ancient scales shimmer faintly in the darkness, waiting for the worthy.
The door will not open by force — only the sacred word,
spoken with understanding, can unseal the chamber of judgment.

<h1>📜 THE LAWS OF MA’AT</h1>

<p>
Within the Hall, the deeds of the fallen are laid bare.
Every action carries weight. Every intention tips the scale.
Study the Laws of Ma’at carefully —
for balance is measured not by outcome, but by purpose.

When a deed seems to fit more than one category,

<p>
The villain has been judged, yet the scales remain fractured.
Anubis has extracted vital truths from the condemned.
Use the revelations to repair the sacred balance,
speak the restoration incantation,
and name the Creator of the Feather —
only then will order return to the Duat.

But balance is not yet restored.
Repair the Scale… if you can.”

Anubis has interrogated the fallen villain.
Under the weight of divine judgment, the condemned revealed
fragments of truth — attributes, alliances, powers, and intent.
These clues form the key to the sacred lock.
Study them carefully. Choose wisely.
